I have configured the Talon voice recognition  configuration with my own custom grammar. Most of that is coded in the files within the 'code/keys' directory.   

i'm currently planning to make some modifications to this configuration using the cursor agent and ide. however because the readme file is the original readme file of the project and i have made several changes, i think i have to modify that so that the curser agent knows more about what's going on in this project. basically i want to give enough context to the agent that its task is mainly to improve the configurations for accuracy and better recognition in general. i will define the specific tasks for the agent later but i want the general knowledge to be established. can you figure out by default which files the cursor agent looks at and then build those files necessary as context. if you look at the  difference between me and the upstream git repository https://github.com/talonhub/community you will be able to figure out roughly what i have changed. i've mainly simplified things for myself and customized it based on my own conventional grammar. feel free to scan the files if necessary
