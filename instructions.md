I have configured the Talon voice recognition  configuration with my own custom grammar. 

I basically already had a grammar defined in dragonfly syntax on windows.
most of that is coded in the files within the code/keys directory.
I have attached my original dragonfly grammar and I want you to doublecheck to see if all of these things that are defined indeed dragonfly grammar are also defined on the talon grammer.
if something is missing
