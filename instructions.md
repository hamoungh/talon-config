I have configured the Talon voice recognition  configuration with my own custom grammar. Most of that is coded in the files within the code/keys directory.

An important part of the grammar is for example when I say for example "up five times" or "hyph twenty times" or "slap five times" in that case I want the same actio to be repeated. 
I want to implement that kind of thing.*

if that sort of functionality doesn't exist in the codebase let's take a look at https://github.com/talonhub/community/tree/main/core maybe there is something useful there or maybe you can search internet to figure out how the people deal with this sort of situation
