I have configured the Talon voice recognition  configuration with my own custom grammar. Most of that is coded in the files within the 'code/keys' directory.   

currently i have some customized commands for the Visual studio code editor.    basically what i want to do is to have a customized set of commands in a new file for cursor ide. or maybe if all the shortcuts are the same we can just reuse the same configuration.
