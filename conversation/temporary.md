Hello Aegis,

So basically here are a few examples where I start by just using the commands for individual alphabets. In this case the performance is pretty fine except for a few alphabets. But as soon as I switch to multiple alphabets in the same phrase, the accuracy starts to drop. Basically two subsequent alphabets work correctly around fifty percent of the time, and three or more alphabets are rarely correct.

The thing is, I'm really trying to switch from Windows to Mac and I have to get this to work, or at least get it to a level that I can start seriously using it.

I'm currently on monthly beta membership. If you think you can give me better support, I can switch to the professional membership for at least three to six months since this is really really important for me. If you could help me optimize my grammar configuration and maybe even help me train or customize a model based on the words that I'm used to, that would be really great.

I have used this alphabet and command set for the past ten years and I'm very used to them. I can make small adjustments but wouldn't be able to change the whole thing.
