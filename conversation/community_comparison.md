# Community vs Personal Configuration Comparison

## Research Method
- Fetched latest from `community` remote (talonhub/community)
- Compared delete/edit command implementations
- Analyzed file structure and command patterns

## Key Architecture Differences

### Command Structure
**Your Config**: Direct command mapping
```
delete: delete
5 dij: key("delete:5")
```

**Community**: Compound command system
```
<edit_action> <edit_modifier>: user.edit_command(action, modifier)
clear 5 right: user.edit_command("delete", "5 right")
```

### File Organization
**Your Config**: 
- Simple talon-list mappings
- Direct keystroke definitions

**Community**:
- Separate action and modifier lists
- Python logic for compound commands
- More modular but complex system

## Flexibility Comparison
**Your Config**: 
- Simpler vocabulary
- Direct, predictable commands
- Less cognitive overhead

**Community**:
- More expressive grammar
- Flexible combinations
- Larger active vocabulary
- More natural language patterns

## Recommendation
Current simplified approach aligns with your stated goal of "accuracy-focused grammar" and reduced active vocabulary as mentioned in AGENT_GUIDE.md.
